        About Us  
        At Second Chance Sanctuary, we are dedicated to providing a safe, loving, and forever home for animals in need. Our sanctuary is a refuge for rescued, abandoned, and mistreated animals, offering them a second chance at life.
        <br><br>
        Founded in 1965, our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and care for animals while promoting kindness, compassion, and awareness about their well-being. From farm animals to wildlife, every creature at our sanctuary receives the love and care they deserve.
        <br><br>
        We believe in ethical treatment, sustainable living, and creating a world where animals are respected and protected. Our team of passionate caregivers, volunteers, and supporters work tirelessly to ensure that each resident lives a life free from harm.
        <br><br>
