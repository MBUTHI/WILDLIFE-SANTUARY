    <P>The Cheetah
        One of the most recognizable animals in Kenya is the cheetah. These spotty cats-cachwith their own unique patterns-are skilled hunters, in part because of their naturalspeed and agility. In fact,cheetahs arethe fastest mammals on earth. They can acceleratefrom zero to 60 miles per hour in just three seconds. Another interesting cheetah fact?Unlike lions, tigers,jaguars, and leopards, cheetahs can't roar-they can only purr.
        These cats live and hunt in open grasslands across Africa.They can be found incountries including Kenya, Algeria, South Africa, and Niger.
        The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classes cheetahsas vulnerable. This means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild. There arejust 6,517 mature cheetahs left in the wild, and their population is decreasing. Cheetahs areat particular risk from habitat loss because they need such a large range.Most cheetahslive in unprotected areas, where they come into conflict with farmers.</P>
